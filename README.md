# Iris-prediction-using-flask
The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset consists of three iris species with 50 samples each along with certain properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The data is structured into different columns namely:
Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
class:
-- Iris Setosa
-- Iris Versicolour
-- Iris Virginica
All the dimensions in cm
